Repo 1 of a collection of repos, containing the random python and pygame projects I've worked on

As the name suggests, its a copy of flappy bird made using pythons pygame library, and is one of my first games.

If you want to run the game on your device, make sure that pygame is installed in the same directory as the main.py file. Then, open main.py in an IDLE and press run, it should work.
For best results, use the pycharm idle as i coded the game in it, but pycharm created a bunch of other folders which took up too much memory, and hence weren't inccluded in the repo.
